# Submarine Crew
My university project work. A local multiplayer game in which, up to 4 players have to navigate a 2D side view submarine through underwater cave maps.
Static areas of rocks, vegetation, dynamic AI enemies and the submarine's finite energy present a difficulty for the players. Of course the submarine has 
extendable and rotatable arms with driller and cutter heads that can destroy these obstacles. If played alone, the game provides support by enabling the submarine to 
use its arms automatically to dispose of obstacles. The game has vibrant colors obscured by darkness. This also adds a layer of difficulty, however the submarine is outfitted 
with a directional reflector that can light about a quarter of the player screen.  
The game is made in Java, using libGDX, a game programming framework. LibGDX is kind of a bare bones framework, 
and I did not want to use rather complicated 2D physics frameworks like Box2D because it would have had way more 
power than my game would ever need. So I ended up creating basic movement and rotation physics.
Game assets were created by my brother and I.
